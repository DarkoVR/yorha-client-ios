#### What I've learned so far.
* As my first ios app VIPER maybe wasn't the best start but the experience is worth it.
* VIPER is hard, use it wisely and just when a project or team is big and experienced enough.
* VIPER really use a modularization principle use this as an advantage.
* VIPER is fun to learn, give it a try.
